SmartStart
==========
######v 1.0

SmartStart is a web project designed to replace the default homepage and new tab page of browsers.

SmartStart stores all settings/user information locally in the web browser, and has no server dependencies. Although, it uses the Reddit and OpenWeather API for a bit of dynamic data.

####Features:
- Use it from your local hard drive or http server and reduce load times to almost nothing
- Everything is stored in your localStorage-enabled browser
- Incompatible browsers can modify the data-* attributes of elements manually and still use the web app
- Completely responsive, works on mobile devices (phones/tablets)
- Gets weather data and weather conditions
- Retrieves a number of postings from your favorite subreddit
- Drag, drop, add, and edit your bookmarks right in the SmartStart homepage

Live Demo
------------
Check out a live preview of it over here.

Keep in mind this is a live preview, you shouldn't use this as your homepage. I will be constantly updating and changing the contents of that live preview (but mostly don't use it because my budget web hosting plan is... bad). Instead, grab a copy of the web app, save it, open it up and you'll save yourself the load time and me the bandwidth!
