SmartStart
==========
######v 1.0

SmartStart is a web project designed to replace the default homepage and new tab page of browsers.

SmartStart stores all settings/user information locally in the web browser, and has no server dependencies. Although, it uses the Reddit and OpenWeather API for a bit of dynamic data.

####Features:
- Use it from your local hard drive or http server and reduce load times to almost nothing
- Everything is stored in your localStorage-enabled browser
- Incompatible browsers can modify the data-* attributes of elements manually and still use the web app
- Completely responsive, works on mobile devices (phones/tablets)
- Gets weather data and weather conditions
- Retrieves a number of postings from your favorite subreddit
- Drag, drop, add, and edit your bookmarks right in the SmartStart homepage

Live App

Check out a live preview of it over here.

If for some reason you don't want to download it and run it locally, you can use the link above as your homepage. I can't promise it'll be up forever, but it will be kept updated for you with the latest changes automatically.

Download

Look to the right and find that "Download as Zip" button. Everything you need is right there!

Browser Integration
---
Unfortunately, Google Chrome doesn't let you change the New Tab page without the use of an extension.  
Changing your home page in the settings and pairing it with this extension should fix everything though!
